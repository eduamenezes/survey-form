This project was carried out for the Compass.uol internship program, where I was able to experience for the first time what it's like to work with deadlines and specific needs. In addition, I had the opportunity to strengthen my knowledge in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It was incredible because in many moments I felt challenged to accomplish the project's objectives.
